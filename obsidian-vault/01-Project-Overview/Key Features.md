    B -->|No| D[Get Latest Version Docs]
    C --> E[Return Targeted Documentation]
    D --> E
    E --> F[AI Assistant Context]
```

## 🎯 Intelligent Library Resolution

### Smart Search Algorithm
Context7 doesn't just do keyword matching - it understands context and intent.

**Search Intelligence Features:**
- **Fuzzy matching**: Finds libraries even with typos
- **Context awareness**: Understands related technologies
- **Popularity weighting**: Prioritizes widely-used libraries
- **Trust scoring**: Identifies authoritative sources

### Example Search Results
```
Query: "react state management"

Results:
1. /facebook/react (Trust: 10, Snippets: 1,847)
2. /reduxjs/redux (Trust: 9, Snippets: 892) 
3. /pmndrs/zustand (Trust: 8, Snippets: 234)
4. /microsoft/fluentui (Trust: 7, Snippets: 445)
```

## 🎛️ Configurable Detail Level

### Token-Based Control
Fine-tune how much documentation you receive based on your needs.

| Token Range | Use Case | Content Level |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 1,000-2,000 | Quick reference | Key APIs only |
| 2,000-5,000 | Standard usage | Common patterns + examples |
| 5,000-10,000 | Deep dive | Comprehensive docs + edge cases |
| 10,000+ | Full context | Everything available |

### Topic Filtering
Get documentation focused on your specific needs:

```typescript
// Focus on authentication
get-library-docs("/supabase/supabase", topic: "authentication")

// Focus on routing
get-library-docs("/vercel/next.js", topic: "routing")

// Focus on state management  
get-library-docs("/facebook/react", topic: "hooks")
```
