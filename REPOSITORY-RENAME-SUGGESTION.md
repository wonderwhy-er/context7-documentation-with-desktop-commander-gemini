# 📋 Repository Rename Suggestion

## Current Repository Name
`context7-documentation-with-desktop-commander-gemini`

## Suggested New Name
`context7-ai-documentation-comparison` 

**or**

`context7-gemini-vs-claude-docs`

**or**

`ai-documentation-showdown-context7`

## Why Rename?

The current name only mentions Gemini, but the repository now contains documentation examples from **both**:
- 🔸 **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (traditional markdown)
- 🔸 **Claude Sonnet 4** (Obsidian vault)

## Benefits of Renaming

1. **🎯 Accurate Description**: Shows it's a comparison of AI approaches
2. **🔍 Better Discoverability**: People searching for AI documentation comparisons will find it
3. **📈 Broader Appeal**: Attracts users interested in both models
4. **🎬 Live Stream Context**: Clearly indicates the experimental/demo nature

2. Scroll down to "Repository name" 
3. Change to new name
4. Update any links in documentation

## Impact

- GitHub will automatically redirect the old URL
- All existing links will continue to work
- Better SEO for documentation comparison searches
