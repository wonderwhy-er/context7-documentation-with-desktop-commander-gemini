# Available Tools in Context7

Context7 MCP provides specific tools that Large Language Models (LLMs) can utilize to fetch and integrate up-to-date documentation directly into their context. These tools enable LLMs to provide more accurate and relevant responses.

Currently, Context7 offers the following tools:

- [[resolve-library-id|`resolve-library-id`]]: Used to resolve a general library name into a Context7-compatible library ID.
- [[get-library-docs|`get-library-docs`]]: Used to fetch documentation for a library using its Context7-compatible library ID.

Each of these tools is detailed further in their respective sections.
