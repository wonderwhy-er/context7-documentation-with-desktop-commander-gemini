# BoltAI Installation

This document provides instructions on how to install and configure Context7 for use with **BoltAI**.

Open the "Settings" page of the app, navigate to "Plugins," and enter the following JSON:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once saved, enter in the chat `get-library-docs` followed by your Context7 documentation ID (e.g., `get-library-docs /nuxt/ui`). More information is available on [BoltAI's Documentation site](https://docs.boltai.com/docs/plugins/mcp-servers). For BoltAI on iOS, [see this guide](https://docs.boltai.com/docs/boltai-mobile/mcp-servers).
