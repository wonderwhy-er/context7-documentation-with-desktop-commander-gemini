# Context7 Installation Guide

This section outlines the general requirements and various methods for installing and configuring Context7. Context7 acts as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with various client applications to provide up-to-date documentation to Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Requirements

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure you meet the following requirements:

-   **Node.js**: Version `v18.0.0` or higher.
-   **MCP Client**: An MCP-compatible client application such as Cursor, Claude Code, VSCode, Windsurf, or others.
-   **Context7 API Key (Optional)**: An API key can be obtained from [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard). This is optional but highly recommended for higher rate limits and full functionality.

## Deprecation Notice

**SSE Protocol Deprecation**: The Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport protocol is deprecated and its endpoint will be removed in upcoming releases. It is recommended to use HTTP or stdio transport methods instead.

## Installation Methods

Context7 can be installed and configured in several ways, depending on your preferred MCP client or environment. The most common methods involve using `npx` for local installations or configuring remote server connections.
